Timestamp,What worked well today?,What didn't work well?,"Did you have a sense of how participants were doing (bored, lost, right on target)?",Is there anything else you'd like to add?
4/8/21 11:43,"The introductory material did a really nice job of providing a sample, population, and the process of random sampling. It's a thoughtfully constructed example dataset and exercise. The material is a gentle way to get the participants' hands dirty in R.","I feel there was a general confusion about the conceptual difference between estimates derived from samples and parameters derived from populations. We also had trouble with side-loaded libraries in R, but that problem appears to be under resolution.",The ones I interacted with seemed like they were on target. Even the ones that had a problem seemed to understand what was going on.,
4/8/21 11:44,,"We might want to reorganize and start with explanation of samples and populations, and then do the first section on pvalue and null distributions",,
4/8/21 12:05,"The virtual learning was okay, course participants seem to be adapting gradually. ",My Audio,I'm not too sure but it seems they were right on target.,
4/8/21 12:28,"From what I could seem, all of the ""communication infrastructure"" worked well - the chat (and emojis), the Etherpad, etc.  ",The lesson materials need to be run through in an empty environment from start to finish to surface issues like the issue with the libraries.  Variable names in the material can be improved to more accurately describe what they are.,It was very hard to tell -- probably a casualty of teaching over zoom.  Using the emojis helped a bit.,
4/8/21 18:08,"Students all seemed to have R installed and came prepared, I liked the instructional portion","The dependencies are messy, I think some students could work through the code in the first part but weren't absorbing the stats part of it (lots of questions -- is this a p-value? Why would we do this? what are we doing?) but maybe this was because they were catching up with the coding and missed some of that portion, so its possible having the setup ironed out could fix those things.","Lost in the beginning, or just hiccupping, and on topic later.","I liked the short lecture then hands on part of the after the break section, seemed like helped with confustion"
4/15/21 13:32,"I think we had a better handle on setup and had fewer ""something is wrong with R"" problems","Having the instructor using base R instead of R studio was confusing and made it hard to follow since you couldn't catch up by looking at the screen at previous commands. It was also confusing that the objects had different names for the instructor vs the student. We're still getting a handle on the MASS problem, but I think that its helpful we all have a handle on it. I also noticed a lot of students left right at the time for the seminar speaker.",lost (and therefore bored) for a good chunk of it ,
4/23/21 14:44,Instructor was a great teacher who explained very clearly.,Nothing,I think it was right on target.,
